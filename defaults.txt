= Defaults

There are some annoying defaults in Inkscape that everyone changes on the first
run. We should identify these annoyances and ship patches where we can't upstream.

If we can't upstream it would be nice to have patches in Fedora.


== No-brainers

- HSL chooser in Fill and Stroke dialog
  This should be the default chooser. The others are almost impossible to use
  for humans in day to day work.
 
- Page shadow
  Ugly, useless. Enough said.

- Icon set
  It's pretty bad looking and, because they're SVGs, not pixel aligned.
  A symbolic set would look much more professional.

- Mouse cursors
  Ugly and pixelated. We should fix this.

- Fill & Stroke dialog is very wide.

== More controversial

- Inkscape has a lot of UI chrome by default. The commands bar can be switched off in
  authoring applications like Inkscape.
  * Snap commands bar (change snapping settings)
  * Commands bar (save, copy+paste, zoom levels, quicktrigger to other tools)
  * Rulers (coordinates and alignment lines)
  * Status bar (current selected object properties)
  
- Tiny palette


== Cross-platform improvements

While most of use use Inkscape exclusively on Linux, it would benefit
the project (and therefore its users and even possibly developers) to
polish up the issues on other platforms, specifically OS X (where a lot
of designers already exist).

(How awesome would it be to have those cheap print shops using Inkscape
instead of Corel Draw? We could just sent SVGs over instead of crappy
EPS files.)


=== OS X issues

  - The major issue is bad keyboard shortcuts (as on the Mac, it works
  differently). 
  
  - The X11 requirement (although some builds have done away with this).

  - Packaged versions are out of date

  - Not available in the official OS X app store

  - Native dialogs

  - Tablet support

  - Widgets don't look native (although OS X now looks more like GTK+3)


=== Windows issues
