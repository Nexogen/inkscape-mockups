= Defaults

There are some annoying defaults in Inkscape that everyone changes on the first
run. We should identifiy these annoyances and ship patches where we can't upstream.

If we can't upstream it would be nice to have patches in Fedora.


== No-brainers

- HSL chooser in Fill and Stroke dialog
  This should be the default chooser. The others are almost impossible to use
  for humans in day to day work.
 
- Page shadow
  Ugly, useless. Enough said.

- Icon set
  It's pretty bad looking and, because they're SVGs, not pixel aligned.

- Mouse cursors
  Ugly and pixelated. We should fix this.

== More contriversial

- Inkscape has a lot of UI chrome. The commands bar can be switched off in
  authoring applications like Inkscape.
  
- Tiny palette
